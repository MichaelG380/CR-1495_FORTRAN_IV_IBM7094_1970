It was initially issued by NIELSEN ENGINEERING & RESEARCH, INC. as Report No. NEAR TR 16.

Report CR-1495 describes a FORTRAN program that ran on an [IBM 7094](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_7090) mainframe computer.

The preceeding report CR-1494 describes the theory behind the program calculations.

As such the two reports combine to provide both the theory and programming to predict fan performance. Internally referenced as NEAR TR 15 & NEAR TR 16 these reports are also of historical interest as the capabilities of NIELSEN ENGINEERING AND RESEACH INC in it's early years.

Today the Hathi Trust Digital Library and NASA NTRS archives offer public access to these reports:

* the calculation theory [CR-1494](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011430639) & [NASA NTRS](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700006092%5F1970006092.pdf)
and
* the program source code [CR-1495](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011430641) & [NASA NTRS](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700012375.pdf)

As such both publications are now in the public domain thanks to NASA, the University of [University of Illinois Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) and the [Hathi Trust Digital Library](https://www.hathitrust.org/).

This project revists the program code I had access to in 1975-6 when I worked to port it onto an [Elliott 4120](https://www.ithistory.org/db/hardware/elliott-brothers-london-ltd/elliott-4120) computer
