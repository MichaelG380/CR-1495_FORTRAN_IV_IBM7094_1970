# CR-1495_FORTRAN_IV_IBM7094_1970

This is the repository for the original CR-1495 code as published by NASA in 1970.

It program is designed to run on an IBM 7094 mainframe computer.

The Hathi Trust Digital Library has copies of the:
* original program theory [CR-1494](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011430639)
and
* this program source code [CR-1495](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011430641)

As such both publications are now in the public domain thanks to the University of [University of Illinois Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) and the [Hathi Trust Digital Library](https://www.hathitrust.org/).

This project revists the program code I had access to in 1975-6 when I worked to port it onto an [Elliott 4120](https://www.ithistory.org/db/hardware/elliott-brothers-london-ltd/elliott-4120) computer
