Report CR-1495 describes a FORTRAN program that was run on an [IBM 7094](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_7090) mainframe computer to predict ducted fan performance.

The preceeding report, CR-1494, describes the theory and mathematics underpinning the computer program.

Internally referenced as NEAR TR 15 & NEAR TR 16 these two reports are of historical interest as the type and quality of work NIELSEN ENGINEERING AND RESEACH INC delivered in it's early years for NASA.

Today both NASA NTRS archives and the Hathi Trust Digital Library offer public access to the reports:

* the calculation theory report CR-1494 - link [NASA NTRS](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700006092%5F1970006092.pdf), [HTDL](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011430639) & [GOOGLE BOOKS](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T3jQ-9s-IbAC)
and
* the program report CR-1495 - link [NASA NTRS](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700012375.pdf) & [HTDL](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011430641)

These links are to scanned images of the original printed reports. Made available thanks to NASA NTRS plus the University of [University of Illinois Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) in conjunction with [Google Books](https://books.google.com) and the [Hathi Trust Digital Library](https://www.hathitrust.org/).

This project revists the program code I had access to in 1975-6 when I worked to port it onto an [Elliott/ICL 4120](https://www.ithistory.org/db/hardware/elliott-brothers-london-ltd/elliott-4120) computer it's also a good example of theory with program documentation.
