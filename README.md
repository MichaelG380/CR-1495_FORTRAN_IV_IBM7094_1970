# CR-1495_FORTRAN_IV_IBM7094_1970

This is the repository for the CR-1495 code as published by NASA in 1970.

This report was prepared under Contract No. NAS 2-4953 by:

NIELSEN ENGINEERING & RESEARCH, INC.
Mountain View, Calif.
for Ames Research Center

It was initially issued by NIELSEN ENGINEERING & RESEARCH, INC. as Report No. NEAR TR 16, thus it's part of the early history for Nielsen.

The CR-1495 report describes a FORTRAN program that ran on an [IBM 7094](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_7090) mainframe computer.

Today the Hathi Trust Digital Library has copies of both NASA Contractor Reports:

* the calculation theory [CR-1494](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011430639)
and
* the program source code [CR-1495](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/011430641)

As such both publications are now in the public domain thanks to the University of [University of Illinois Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) and the [Hathi Trust Digital Library](https://www.hathitrust.org/).

This project revists the program code I had access to in 1975-6 when I worked to port it onto an [Elliott 4120](https://www.ithistory.org/db/hardware/elliott-brothers-london-ltd/elliott-4120) computer
